[Interlaken Group](http://www.interlakengroup.org/) The Interlaken Group is a multi-stakeholder forum composed of representatives from companies, investors, international organizations, and civil society groups. First convened in 2013, the Interlaken Group meets regularly to identify practical ways in which companies and their investors can support improved land and forest governance and the tenure rights of rural populations.
